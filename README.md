# Reasons

First, a little about me. I strive for efficiency. Because I'm lazy? No, well
sort of... The primary reasons are my inner desires to do more with less, make
something out of nothing, and give more than I take. As person who doesn't have
the greatest memory, I often forget why I'm doing something and end up doing
unnecessary work that doesn't put me anywhere closer to my goals. The exact
opposite of efficient. In order to break my limits and become a bit more 
efficient, I decided to document the reasons behind the decisions I make.

*Note*: All documents in this repository will forever be in progress. In other
words, they will get better over time.
