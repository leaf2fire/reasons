# Desire

I wish that...

1. Effort and hard work are not wasted and are appropriately rewarded.
2. Everyone respects each other and themselves.
3. No one has to worry about the physical costs and limitations of existing.
4. Imagination is the limit to break.
5. People can be more honest with themselves and others.
6. I could design a city and live in it.
