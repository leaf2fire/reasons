# Desire

A list of some of my big goals and dreams as well as my likes and preferences.

## The Grander

I wish that...

1. Effort and hard work are not wasted and are appropriately rewarded.
2. Everyone respects each other and themselves.
3. No one has to worry about the physical costs and limitations of existing.
4. Imagination is the limit to break.
5. People can be more honest with themselves and others.
6. I could design a city, have it built, and live in it.
7. The top companies to work for are non-profit companies.

## Inclinations

I like...

1. People who are rationally passionate. The kind of person who takes calculated
risks. The kind of person whom anyone watching wants to see succeed.
2. Things that have a functional purpose. I'm a utilitarian.
3. Learning. It's fun.
4. People who try to understand the whole story before judging.
