# Hardware

When choosing hardware for personal use, I adopt the "good enough" approach. I
first consider the day-to-day use cases. I currently use my computer for the 
following "resource demanding" applications:

* Text editors and IDEs
* League of Legends (lowest settings)
* Browser (streaming, email, reading random articles)
* Blender, Inkscape, Krita

Then I consider the rarer cases. Rendering large projects, editing large
images, and training machine learning models will certainly demand a lot of 
resources. For me, the rarer cases don't matter enough to warrant a more 
powerful computer, so I basically ignore them. If I need the extra oomph on
occasion, I can always tap into the cloud.

Right now, most prebuilt computers with sufficient RAM will satisfy my
requirements. Since my disk memory requirements aren't particularly high, I'll
choose SSD over HDD pretty much every time.

No customization required yet.
